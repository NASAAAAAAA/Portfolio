What this project is all about
This repository is built for individuals who want to present their work in a clear, confident way. The site emphasizes readability, fast load times, and a responsive layout that looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops. It uses practical web technologies and a modular approach so you can swap in projects, change colors, or adjust typography without breaking the layout. The design foregrounds content—images, titles, and descriptions—so visitors can quickly grasp your value and reach out with intent.

The core idea is to offer a portfolio that feels personal yet professional. It should mirror your style while staying accessible to a wide audience. The layout supports a gallery of work, a short bio, links to contact forms, and a resume section. You should be able to publish updates with minimal friction. This repo is not a public gallery of randomness; it is a curated space for your professional narrative.

Design principles
The design choices in this portfolio emphasize clarity and ease of use. The typography is legible, with a comfortable line length and ample white space. The color palette is restrained to avoid fatigue during long reads. Images and media are used to complement the content, not overwhelm it. The layout adapts to different screen sizes so the same content remains accessible and readable on mobile devices.

- Consistency
  - Use a single system for typography and spacing
  - Keep components consistent across sections
- Clarity
  - Present information in short, direct statements
  - Use headings and bullet points to guide the reader
- Performance
  - Optimize images and assets
  - Minimize JavaScript and CSS where possible
  - Use modern techniques to reduce render-blocking resources
- Accessibility
  - Ensure navigable structure with proper heading order
  - Provide alt text for all images and meaningful link titles
  - Support keyboard and screen reader usage

Responsive design and accessibility
A portfolio must be accessible to a broad audience. The responsive design adapts to screens of all sizes. The typography scales gracefully, and media queries ensure that content reflows without breaking the layout. The color palette maintains good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds.

- Headings and landmarks
  - Clear, hierarchical headings help screen readers interpret content
  - Landmark regions like nav, main, and footer provide easy navigation
- Focus management
  - Visible focus indicators ensure keyboard users can track focus
  - Logical tab order makes sense as users move through sections
- Images and media
